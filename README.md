This project creates an Etch-A-Sketch that responds to mouse movements.

The active area contains "pixels" that deepen shade upon successive entry.
The pixel size can be changed through the use of the 'New Sketch' button.

This project was undertaken to solidify and demonstrate ability to create and manipulate elements using ES6.
